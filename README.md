# Brain-tumor-detection-using-deep-learning


Developed a deep learning model utilizing Resnet, VGG16, and CNN architectures to accurately detect brain tumors in MRI images.
Preprocessed the images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the data to enhance model robustness.
Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on an independent test dataset.
Achieved the highest accuracy of 75% using the CNN architecture, showcasing its superior performance for this task.
